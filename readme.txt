TDC evaluates your tags and categories, suggests consolidations and helps identify ways to improve your use of WordPress' built-in taxonomies.

== Description ==

Term Debt Consolidator can look at your WordPress site's tags and categories to suggest areas for consolidation and deletion and help you identify ways to improve your use of WordPress' taxonomy functionality.

Keep in mind that this process is imperfect and may make nonsensical suggestions from time to time. It's up to you to review the suggestions and approve or deny them.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/term-debt-consolidator` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
